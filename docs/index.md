## Editing the Documentation

It will be helpful to note a few things about how to alter this documentation.

First, all the sources go in *references.bib*. If we need to add more files, we can add them in itemized form below plugins -> bibtex -> bibfiles.

Second, we can add as many pages as we want. In general, try to keep each page its own markdown file and link to it.
